{- 
This puts together a new "buffered Socket". or bSock
A buffered socket is a socket which is acommodated by a Ptr. Because of the need to split headers etc up at certain points but still
safet he rest of the data to be whatever the server requires it to be.

A buffered socket should be called with freeBSocket before disregarded. 
The server thunk function does so automaticly.
